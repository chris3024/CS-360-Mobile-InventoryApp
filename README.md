# The instructions said upload zip, but the file size was to large. So I committed and pushed project to repo.

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

##### The app's requirements and goals were to create an inventory-tracking application. The app includes a login to access the central part, where users can add, edit, and delete items. Also, email notification of low stock was set up. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

##### The screens necessary for this app were screens for user login, a central display screen, a screen to add items, and a screen to edit and delete the items. The app keep the user's in mind by making it easy to navigate. They were successful without having a cluttered look or feel.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

##### The strategies I used to code the app started with prototyping and setting up the UI layouts. Then, I code the app incrementally to ensure error-free and functioning code. This can be applied to all future products to ensure an error-free code base. 

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

##### I ran many tests throughout the coding process to ensure the app was functioning correctly without any side effects and that only the intended outcomes were achievable. This further revealed the need for incremental development to catch as many bugs as possible. 

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

##### The most significant change I had to make was in the RecyclerView and CardView to hold the data. I had trouble with the embedded buttons, so I had to create design changes to streamline the development. 

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

##### I believe the component that stands out the most to me is the activity launched from the CardView of the item that allows for editing and deletion.
